## Events Naming Convention

This is not a recommendation but can be helpful to define or get event names used across user synthetics

```php
Events::addListener('uss:pages/users@nav.dropdown', ...);
```

The above event name `uss:pages/users@nav.dropdown` can be broken down to:

-  `uss:`  &mdash; The identity / source of the event
-  `pages/users`  &mdash;  The event name or possible point of execution
-  `@nav`  &mdash;  An element in which the event can be found or referenced. In this case `<nav>`
-  `.dropdown`
	- May signify action spanning the event. Other examples may include `.click`, `.submit` etc. 
	- It may also be used to reference element position of an event such as `.top`, `.left`, `.right`, or `.bottom`
